# Docker Quickstart

Run Paperclip in Docker without installing Node or pnpm locally.

All commands below assume you are in the **project root** (the directory containing `package.json`), not inside `docker/`.

## Building the image

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local .
```

The Dockerfile installs common agent tools (`git`, `gh`, `curl`, `wget`, `ripgrep`, `python3`), runs the app under `tini` as PID 1 for signal handling/zombie reaping, and installs the Claude, Codex, and OpenCode CLIs.

Build arguments:

| Arg | Default | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `USER_UID` | `1000` | UID for the container `node` user (match your host UID to avoid permission issues on bind mounts) |
| `USER_GID` | `1000` | GID for the container `node` group |

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local \
  --build-arg USER_UID=$(id -u) --build-arg USER_GID=$(id -g) .
```

## One-liner (build + run)

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local . && \
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -e PAPERCLIP_TOOL_ACTION_SIGNING_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

Open: `http://localhost:3100`

Data persistence:

- Embedded PostgreSQL data
- uploaded assets
- local secrets key
- local agent workspace data

All persisted under your bind mount (`./data/docker-paperclip` in the example above).

## Docker Compose

### Quickstart (embedded SQLite)

Single container, no external database. Data persists via a bind mount.

```sh
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
PAPERCLIP_TOOL_ACTION_SIGNING_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

Defaults:

- host port: `3100`
- persistent data dir: `./data/docker-paperclip`

Optional overrides:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_PORT=3200 PAPERCLIP_DATA_DIR=../data/pc \
  docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

**Note:** `PAPERCLIP_DATA_DIR` is resolved relative to the compose file (`docker/`), so `../data/pc` maps to `data/pc` in the project root.

If you change host port or use a non-local domain, set `PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL` to the external URL you will use in browser/auth flows.

Pass `OPENAI_API_KEY` and/or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to enable local adapter runs.

### Root Compose stack (embedded PostgreSQL by default)

The root Compose stack starts Paperclip with its embedded PostgreSQL by default.
It also starts Redis. The nginx TLS proxy is optional and stays disabled unless
the `proxy` profile is enabled.

```sh
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Paperclip data, including the embedded PostgreSQL cluster, defaults to
`./data/docker-paperclip`.

To use the separate PostgreSQL 18 service instead, configure `.env` and enable
its Compose profile:

```dotenv
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change-me
DATABASE_URL=postgres://paperclip:***@postgres:5432/paperclip
POSTGRES_DATA_DIR=postgres-data
COMPOSE_PROFILES=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:+postgres}
```

The PostgreSQL service is health-checked before Paperclip starts. Its data
source defaults to the Docker named volume `postgres-data`; set
`POSTGRES_DATA_DIR` to an absolute host path when host-managed storage is
preferred. Changing this setting selects a different, initially empty database
location; existing data is not migrated automatically. PostgreSQL 18 keeps the
cluster in a major-version subdirectory inside this data source.

When `DATABASE_URL` points to a remote PostgreSQL server, set only
`DATABASE_URL` and leave `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` unset. The profile expression then
stays empty and Compose does not build, create, or start the local PostgreSQL
service. You can always enable it explicitly with
`docker compose --profile postgres up`.

The root `docker-compose.yml` also includes an optional nginx TLS proxy. When
enabled, it generates a self-signed certificate for `localhost` into the
`proxy-certs` Docker volume, publishes the Paperclip port only on
`127.0.0.1:${PAPERCLIP_PORT:-3100}`, and publishes proxy ports `80` and `443`.
The Paperclip container also resolves `host.docker.internal` through Docker's
host gateway. Host-specific domains and real certificate mounts belong in
ignored local override files such as `docker-compose.override.yml`, not in
tracked git files.

Put hostnames and public URL values in `.env`:

```dotenv
PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL=https://paperclip.example.com
PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES=paperclip.example.com
PAPERCLIP_TLS_SERVER_NAME=paperclip.example.com
PAPERCLIP_TLS_CERT_ALT_NAMES=DNS:paperclip.example.com,DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1
# Keep this line after POSTGRES_PASSWORD and PAPERCLIP_TLS_SERVER_NAME.
COMPOSE_PROFILES=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:+postgres}${PAPERCLIP_TLS_SERVER_NAME:+${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:+,}proxy}
```

This expression independently enables PostgreSQL when `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is
set and the proxy when `PAPERCLIP_TLS_SERVER_NAME` is set. You can always enable
the proxy explicitly with `docker compose --profile proxy up`. Without its
profile, Compose does not build, create, or start the proxy service.

For a real certificate, keep only the host-specific bind mounts in a local
override similar to this:

```yaml
services:
  paperclip:
    group_add:
      - "${DOCKER_GID:-992}"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
  proxy:
    volumes:
      - /path/to/fullchain.pem:/etc/nginx/certs/fullchain.pem:ro
      - /path/to/key.pem:/etc/nginx/certs/key.pem:ro
```

`group_add`, Docker socket mounts, and certificate bind mounts are Compose
structure and cannot be added by `.env` alone. Keep them in the ignored local
override. The values referenced by the tracked Compose file, including
`DOCKER_GID`, public hostnames, and TLS names, belong in `.env`.

### Untrusted PR review

Isolated container for reviewing untrusted pull requests with Codex or Claude, without exposing your host machine. See `doc/UNTRUSTED-PR-REVIEW.md` for the full workflow.

```sh
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.untrusted-review.yml build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.untrusted-review.yml run --rm --service-ports review
```

## Authenticated Compose (Single Public URL)

For authenticated deployments, set one canonical public URL and let Paperclip derive auth/callback defaults:

```yaml
services:
  paperclip:
    environment:
      PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE: authenticated
      PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_EXPOSURE: private
      PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL: https://desk.koker.net
```

`PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL` is used as the primary source for:

- auth public base URL
- Better Auth base URL defaults
- bootstrap invite URL defaults
- hostname allowlist defaults (hostname extracted from URL)

For fresh `authenticated/private` Docker or appliance-style installs, the first
admin can now be claimed entirely from the browser after sign-in. Open the
Paperclip URL, sign in or create an account, then choose `Claim this instance`
on the setup screen. This browser claim is disabled for `authenticated/public`;
public deployments should run the high-entropy CLI invite fallback instead:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai auth bootstrap-ceo
```

Granular overrides remain available if needed (`PAPERCLIP_AUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES`).

Set `PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` explicitly only when you need additional hostnames beyond the public URL host (for example Tailscale/LAN aliases or multiple private hostnames).

### Optional Vercel Connect credentials

Vercel Connect's backend integration is retained for controlled testing and
existing Vercel-backed connections, but its new-connection UI is currently
withheld from **Apps → Browse**. Setting
`PAPERCLIP_VERCEL_CONNECT_ENABLED=true` does not expose a customer-facing setup
entry. Native provider setup screens remain unchanged. Vercel-hosted deployments use the
workload OIDC token Vercel injects. Other hosted and self-hosted deployments
can provide `PAPERCLIP_VERCEL_CONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN` as a deployment bootstrap
secret only when that token type is accepted by the live Connect API:

```yaml
services:
  paperclip:
    environment:
      PAPERCLIP_VERCEL_CONNECT_ENABLED: "true"
      PAPERCLIP_VERCEL_CONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${PAPERCLIP_VERCEL_CONNECT_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

Do not save that access token in a company secret or connection config. It is
instance bootstrap authority for the operator-selected Vercel account. A token's
long expiry and broad Vercel scope do not prove Connect compatibility; validate
it with connector metadata before rollout. Workload OIDC takes precedence when
both authorities are present. Turning the feature flag off hides new
Vercel-backed setup; existing connections keep resolving while workload OIDC or
the bootstrap token remains available. Missing or invalid authority fails
closed. See the [Vercel Connect operator guide](./connections/VERCEL-CONNECT.md).

## Claude + Codex Local Adapters in Docker

The image pre-installs:

- `claude` (Anthropic Claude Code CLI)
- `codex` (OpenAI Codex CLI)

If you want local adapter runs inside the container, pass API keys when starting the container:

```sh
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=... \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

Notes:

- Without API keys, the app still runs normally.
- Adapter environment checks in Paperclip will surface missing auth/CLI prerequisites.

## Podman Quadlet (systemd)

The `docker/quadlet/` directory contains unit files to run Paperclip + PostgreSQL as systemd services via Podman Quadlet.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docker/quadlet/paperclip.pod` | Pod definition — groups containers into a shared network namespace |
| `docker/quadlet/paperclip.container` | Paperclip server — joins the pod, connects to Postgres at `127.0.0.1` |
| `docker/quadlet/paperclip-db.container` | PostgreSQL 17 — joins the pod, health-checked |

### Setup

1. Build the image (see above).

2. Copy quadlet files to your systemd directory:

   ```sh
   # Rootless (recommended)
   cp docker/quadlet/*.pod docker/quadlet/*.container \
     ~/.config/containers/systemd/

   # Or rootful
   sudo cp docker/quadlet/*.pod docker/quadlet/*.container \
     /etc/containers/systemd/
   ```

3. Create a secrets env file (keep out of version control):

   ```sh
   cat > ~/.config/containers/systemd/paperclip.env <<EOL
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   PAPERCLIP_TOOL_ACTION_SIGNING_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
   POSTGRES_USER=paperclip
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=paperclip
   POSTGRES_DB=paperclip
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://paperclip:paperclip@127.0.0.1:5432/paperclip
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
   EOL
   ```

4. Create the data directory and start:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.local/share/paperclip
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   systemctl --user start paperclip-pod
   ```

### Quadlet management

```sh
journalctl --user -u paperclip -f        # App logs
journalctl --user -u paperclip-db -f     # DB logs
systemctl --user status paperclip-pod    # Pod status
systemctl --user restart paperclip-pod   # Restart all
systemctl --user stop paperclip-pod      # Stop all
```

### Quadlet notes

- **First boot**: Unlike Docker Compose's `condition: service_healthy`, Quadlet's `After=` only waits for the DB unit to *start*, not for PostgreSQL to be ready. On a cold first boot you may see one or two restart attempts in `journalctl --user -u paperclip` while PostgreSQL initialises — this is expected and resolves automatically via `Restart=on-failure`.
- Containers in a pod share `localhost`, so Paperclip reaches Postgres at `127.0.0.1:5432`.
- PostgreSQL data persists in the `paperclip-pgdata` named volume.
- Paperclip data persists at `~/.local/share/paperclip`.
- For rootful quadlet deployment, remove `%h` prefixes and use absolute paths.

## Onboard Smoke Test (Ubuntu + npm only)

Use this when you want to mimic a fresh machine that only has Ubuntu + npm and verify:

- `npx paperclipai onboard --yes` completes
- the server binds to `0.0.0.0:3100` so host access works
- onboard/run banners and startup logs are visible in your terminal

Build + run:

```sh
./scripts/docker-onboard-smoke.sh
```

Open: `http://localhost:3131` (default smoke host port)

Useful overrides:

```sh
HOST_PORT=3200 PAPERCLIPAI_VERSION=latest ./scripts/docker-onboard-smoke.sh
PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=authenticated PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_EXPOSURE=private ./scripts/docker-onboard-smoke.sh
SMOKE_DETACH=true SMOKE_METADATA_FILE=/tmp/paperclip-smoke.env PAPERCLIPAI_VERSION=latest ./scripts/docker-onboard-smoke.sh
```

Notes:

- Persistent data is mounted at `./data/docker-onboard-smoke` by default.
- Container runtime user id defaults to your local `id -u` so the mounted data dir stays writable while avoiding root runtime.
- Smoke script defaults to `authenticated/private` mode so `HOST=0.0.0.0` can be exposed to the host.
- Smoke script defaults host port to `3131` to avoid conflicts with local Paperclip on `3100`.
- Smoke script also defaults `PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL` to `http://localhost:<HOST_PORT>` so bootstrap invite URLs and auth callbacks use the reachable host port instead of the container's internal `3100`.
- In authenticated mode, the smoke script defaults `SMOKE_AUTO_BOOTSTRAP=true` and drives the real bootstrap path automatically: it signs up a real user, runs `paperclipai auth bootstrap-ceo` inside the container to mint a real bootstrap invite, accepts that invite over HTTP, and verifies board session access.
- Run the script in the foreground to watch the onboarding flow; stop with `Ctrl+C` after validation.
- Set `SMOKE_DETACH=true` to leave the container running for automation and optionally write shell-ready metadata to `SMOKE_METADATA_FILE`.
- Set `SMOKE_CONTAINER_NAME` to fix the container's name up front. Automation that has to collect diagnostics when the script *fails* needs a name it already knows, rather than one it can only read back out of a successful run. Defaults to the image name.
- The container's logs are dumped to `SMOKE_LOG_FILE` (default `$TMPDIR/<container name>.log`) before the script tears the container down, so a run that never became ready still leaves its logs behind.
- The image definition is in `docker/Dockerfile.onboard-smoke`.

## General Notes

- The `docker-entrypoint.sh` adjusts the container `node` user UID/GID at startup to match the values passed via `USER_UID`/`USER_GID`, avoiding permission issues on bind-mounted volumes.
- Paperclip data persists via Docker volumes/bind mounts (compose) or at `~/.local/share/paperclip` (quadlet).
